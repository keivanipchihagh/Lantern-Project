# Lantern-Project
Lightweight web-based platform designed provide synchronous chat capability &amp; AI-driven conversation with customers.
<br/>
## Front-End
[VueJs](www.vuejs.org) and [UIkit](www.getuikit.com) are used for the Front-End as well as **Django**'s build-in support for the templates.
<br/>
## Back-End
**Django 3.1** as used the backend framework due to its utility & community support. Despite the reputation for speed, it has handled pretty much everything by now. In the meantime, a **.NET Core 5.1** version is also being developed as a replacement if I decided to publish the product.
<br/>
## Database
The database is designed using [dbdiagram.io](www.dbdiagram.io) and managed by **MySQL**. System is designed to automate everything from payment and registration to template creation and analysis.

## Authentication 
I used **Digital signature**, **Cryptography (RSA, ECC)** and **Authentication tokens** to enforce safety of the service. Although nothing sensitive should be sent through the service, I tried a few concepts just for fun! :sunglasses:
